Renderer Project
by Nick Pascucci

This is a simple renderer project written from scratch in Java.
I've been working on this on and off since October 2011, and it's 
developed a fairly straightforward feature set. It currently supports
3D meshes composed of triangular faces with transparency and both ambient
and diffuse lighting. There are no fancy shaders as of yet, but maybe
in the future... Right now, I'm primarily working on object manipulation
and creation, and once that becomes workable I'll focus on eye candy a 
little more.

Some background on the project: I started this renderer as a final project
for my computer graphics course at the Colorado College. It had a few bugs
which I've since fixed, but it was overall a great success! I'm still
interested in improving on it, so I'll occasionally clean up a bug here and
there and add new features. 

Feel free to use the source under the included license. Please, don't plagiarize
my work; especially not for academic projects. It's just not cool.

Cheers,
